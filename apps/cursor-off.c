/**
 * @brief cursor-off - Disables the VGA text mode cursor.
 *
 * This is an old tool that calls a special system call
 * to change the VGA text-mode cursor position. The VGA
 * terminal renders its own cursor in software, so we
 * try to move the hardware cursor off screen so it doesn't
 * interfere with the rest of the terminal and look weird.
